# Snap and Delete

This is a Python script that uses the sounddevice and numpy modules to record audio from your microphone and detect snap sounds. If a snap sound is detected, it will delete the system32 folder from your Windows machine. This is a fun way to prank your friends or enemies, or to simply get rid of your operating system in a snap. ðŸ˜ˆ
